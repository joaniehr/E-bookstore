# E-bookstore: Final Capstone

Project Description:
The e-bookstore is an application that stores information about books in a database and allows users to access and manipulate this database. 

Project Installation: 
The project can be run using any IDE capable of running Python files. The project does not require any specific installation as the sqlite3 module is imported within the programme.

Project Usage:
Upon running the project, the user is first presented with the below menu:

From this menu, the user is able to enter the number of the option that they wish to access. This will then prompt additional options to appear:
  1. Add book - Takes input for book information and adds to database.
  2. Update book - Allows the user to edit information of a book that is already within the database.
  3. Delete book - Allows the user to delete a specific book from the database.
  4. Search book - Allows the user to search for a book in the database using its ID, title or author.
  5. Exit - Exits the programme.

When using the search feature, the user is presented with an additional menu to allow for a more user-friendly approach. This menu is shown below:
